[My Portfolio](https://joey-sisk.github.io/) page is meant to be an evolving often updated representation and advertisement for my services and abilitys as a webdesigner and developer. The page should include links to my deployed projects in an asthetic way and be built using best practices so that an employer would know that I would be bringing those positive habits with me if they were to hire me. This website should also show that I have a strong understanding of modern web design fundimentals like an adaptive layout that is intuitive and adapts to any sreen size.
