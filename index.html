        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a student web developer, musician, artist, and technician working in and around Austin, TX. I've had the good fortune of performing with some of the best musicians in the Austin area over the last 9 years. During the past 9 years I've worked a variety of jobs from delivering pizzas to working in a construction related technical field. I've recently turned down a new path in order to better myself by signing up for UT's full stack development course and learning JavaScript as well as many of the supporting systems related to it.</p>
